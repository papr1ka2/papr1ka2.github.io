Hi, I'm Gye Jin, a third year PhD student at Georgia Tech.
I am a member of the [Systems Software and Security Lab](https://gts3.org/) lead by my advisor [Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/).

I'm broadly interested the intersection of software security and mathematics.
Currently I am digging into
 - zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation
 - symbolic execution and software verification
 - smart contract security

Please check out my [CV](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
