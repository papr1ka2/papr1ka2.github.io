Hi, I'm Gye Jin, a PhD student at Georgia Tech working with [Prof.Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/) at the [Systems Software and Security Lab](https://gts3.org/).

I am also a member of [Team Atlanta](https://team-atlanta.github.io/), the winner of the DARPA [AIxCC](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) competition.

I'm broadly interested in the intersection between software security and mathematics.
Currently I am digging into
 - symbolic execution and software verification
 - smart contract security
 - zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation

For more details, please check out my [CV](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
